# LotteryNumbers
#This Python program does some calculations with the winning numbers of the Powerball lottery game.
#The file \"BasePower.txt\" has the winning numbers from 2007 to Sep 2018.
#This is not a suggestion to play lottery or to use those numbers.
#I do it to practice my GitHub and share a Python program.
